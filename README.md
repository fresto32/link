## Objectives

1. Retain the knowledge of the card into the future
2. Enhance acquisition and retention rate
3. Make studying a delight

## Game Design

### Retain knowledge of the card into the future

- Reintroduce card to user when they are just about to forget it
  - Neuroscience relevance: spaced repetition

### Enhance acquisition and retention rate

- Associate some visual or spatial 'landmark' information of the card to the topic being covered
  - Landmarks ought to be associated with options and prompts
  - The map can also act as a landmark/que for memory in topography, terrain type, colors, etc
  - Neuroscience relevance: taking advantage of visual and spatial memory

### Make studying a delight

- Gamification Elements
- Avatar should be able to be developed
- A leaderboard / some feedback system ought to be implemented to reflect the amount of effort a student has put into their revision
- Feedback for the speed of them answering some Remembrance Card
